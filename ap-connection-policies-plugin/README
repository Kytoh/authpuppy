# apConnectionPoliciesPlugin plugin (for symfony 1.4 and authpuppy 1.0) #

This plugin allows to define network policies for various authentication 
types and subtypes of the system.  Connections policies are the data throughput 
and/or duration of the connection for a given period or absolute.  When someone 
connect to the network, the maximum data throughput or connection expiration is 
calculated.  The least of the policies that apply is taken.
